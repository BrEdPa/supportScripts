HAHA A RESTART DID IT
I would prefer if the app would update in real time but the principle works. So the best option I can see is to keep the detection rule present, then modify the script to work as a powershell app and apply it to a remediation group for any of the installs we see fail. That way it'll just push the file and correct the install upon next restart. I would prefer something more elegant, ideally a remediation script that would catch any bad install of umbrella on a production machine and then add the file in so it's good to go before the upgrade; that would also reduce the number of security issues prior to our rollout. I'll look into it, but I don't think it's feasible all things considered. The voaConfig method works and can be easily applied here, but it still requires manual intervention when automatic would be better.
